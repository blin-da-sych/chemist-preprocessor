Real reactions was used to understand the concept.

:Future

For instance, we can create a new relationship to indicate whether or not
an inorganic catalyst can poison an enzyme. For example, Tetraethyllead (Pb(CH3CH2)4)
is known to be a potent enzyme inhibitor, particularly for those involved in
neurotransmitter processes. Additionally, heavy metals like mercury (Hg), lead (Pb),
and cadmium (Cd) are notorious for their ability to inhibit various enzymatic activities,
leading to significant toxic effects in biological systems.
